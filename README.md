# 🐺 Remus

Remus is a collection of highly-opinionated EVM primitives for smart contract development. When Romulus and Remus became adults, they decided to found a city where the wolf had found them. **This is our city.**

**Without Remus, you would have to:**

Without ts-reset:

- 🚨 build the primitives of every protocol yourself.
- 🤦 re-implement logic and code that's already been battle-tested.
- 😡 spend more time writing code than architecting the model.

ts-reset smooths over these hard edges, just like a CSS reset does in the browser.

**With Remus:**

- 👍 build on top of established concepts and frameworks.
- ✅ use a consistent, well-tested, and well-documented codebase.
- 🥹 write less code and unlock the power of ecosystem interoperability.
- 🚀 And several more changes!

The primitive stack of Remus consists of:

```ml
src
├─ lib
|  ├─ ✅ LibColorRGB - "Library for working with `uint24` RGB colors."
```
